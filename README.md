The anotated photo server project done on FEL ČVUT during the summer. All sources, my own scraper files and one big connected database maker.

3. I have some modules in my work and one complete blend for namus server
4. MariaDB, pymysql modules required
5. You just need to set a timer to run my script all_together.py and have search payload.json present in that same folder
6. Then you have the database growing in your MariaDB under name "scraper"
